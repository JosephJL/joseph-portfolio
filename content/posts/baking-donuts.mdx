## Context

My partner always sends me instagram posts on food. Recently she sent a post with a delicious tray of cream donuts (CD) made by @ahnestkitchen that caught my eye. There are a few reasons why I decided to take up baking this particular CD among the other food instagram posts that was sent to me. Firstly, this CD was not commercially available. It would be simple to simply order the CD from the bakery to have at it. Secondly, I'm not great at working with dough. In particular my understanding of kneading, proofing and other dough related know-how was lacking. This would be a good chance for me to polish my skill in dough making.
