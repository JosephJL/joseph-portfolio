## Context

My partner always sends me instagram posts on food. Recently she sent a post with a delicious tray of cream donuts (CD) made by @ahnestkitchen that caught my eye. There are a few reasons why I decided to take up baking this particular CD among the other food instagram posts that was sent to me. Firstly, this CD was not commercially available. It would be simple to simply order the CD from the bakery to have at it. Secondly, I'm not great at working with dough. In particular my understanding of kneading, proofing and other dough related know-how was lacking. This would be a good chance for me to polish my skill in dough making.

## The Plan

To make a CD can be broken down into two parts. The donut, and the cream filling. The plan in general was simple, successfully make a donut, then make a cream filling. Currently I expect the difficulty of making the donut to be high, as making a donut in itself consists of a few steps with multiple points of failure. For the cream filling the difficulty is perceived to be lower as it doesn't require as many steps.

The overall difficulty in replicating the CD is emphasised by the fact that the post didn't specify the recipe used for the CD. Hence I'll need to source for various donut and cream recipes and potentially go through a few before deciding on the best combination.

## The First Attempt

I know this looks like fried chicken, but it is actually a donut. It tasted sour and was dense. Based on this, there were a few things I wanted to do differently and I set to work the next weekend.

## The Second Attempt

Much better.
